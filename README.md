# 6502 Breadboard Computer

This is a repo containing code (and schematics and whatever) related to my [Ben Eater inspired](https://eater.net/6502) breadboard computer using the [MOS Technologies 6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) (actually its modern equivalent, the [Western Design Company W65C02](https://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/w65c02s-chip.php), which is still in production as of this writing).

This project is currently pretty empty (as you can see), and I'm not entirely sure where I'll be taking this! I will likely begin this very similar to Ben Eater's 6502 computer, but I will likely try to make some alterations as I see fit.
